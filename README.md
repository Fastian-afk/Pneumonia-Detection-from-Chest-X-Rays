# Pneumonia-Detection-from-Chest-X-Rays
This project visualizes attention maps using **Grad-CAM** on a ResNet18 model trained for binary classification of chest X-ray images (NORMAL vs PNEUMONIA).  The goal is to understand **where the model focuses** when diagnosing pneumonia, providing interpretability and transparency to deep learning in healthcare.
